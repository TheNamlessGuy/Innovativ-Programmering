The domain consists of a set of rooms,
a set of boxes which can't be picked up, but can me moved and climbed,
a set of small objects which can me picked up and put down,
and (of course) one shakey, who in turn has two arms.

The goal is for Shakey to pick up a toy and move it to a different room.

The variables chosen would be the number of toys, how many should be moved, and to how many different rooms.

RESULTS:
    FF:
    4 toys, 1 move, 1 room => 0.00 seconds, 8 steps
    4 toys, 4 move, 2 room => 0.00 seconds, 18 steps
    16 toys, 16 move, 3 room => 0.00 seconds, 54 steps
    
    LAMA:
    4 toys, 1 move, 1 room => 0.02 seconds, 14 cost
    4 toys, 4 move, 2 room => 0.59 seconds, 24 cost
    16 toys, 16 move, 3 room => 30+ min, ??? cost

CONCLUSION:
LAMA seems to both take longer time, and also find worse results. The latter part might very well be in part to the particular problems
I put it through, and might be opposite in more complicated matters (or even if the last test had finished running).

Most of LAMAs time seems to come from it trying to find a good heuristic (as that is where it got stuck for over 30 minutes).
It, of course, also takes longer time since it runs in three separate programs which communicate through files.
This means that all the data between the parts need to be written to disk, then immediately read again. This would an exponential amount of time.

I should mention I also ran these test through SSH from a computer at home, so the results may be (slightly) different on location.

In conclusion, (at least for my domain) ff is the better solution.
