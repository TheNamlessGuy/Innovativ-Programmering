8. No, there is no If-Modified-Since, since there is nothing in the browsers cache for the site.

9. Yes, the server sent the file. You can tell by checking the "Content-Type" and "Content-Length" tags. You can also check the data sent after the package header to see if it sent it all.

10. Yes, and the data that follows contains the date the file currently stored in the cache was last modified.

11. The server sent no data, since it has no "Content-Length" tag, and it sent a "304 Not Modified" message, which means that the server won't send a new version (since it was "Not Modified").

We discovered that if the browser has no cached version of the website it is trying to connect to, it will ask for it without a "If-Modified-Since"-tag (how would it know which point in time to ask for?). However, if the browser has a cached version of the website it will append the tag, so the server won't send a new copy and, as a result, spend less bandwidth.
