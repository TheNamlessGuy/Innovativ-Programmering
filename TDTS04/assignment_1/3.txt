12. One, as you can see if you filter the packages after HTTP.

13. 4 packages, as can be seen by checking the [x Reassembled TCP...]-tag in the server's HTTP response.
You can also check by simply counting the TCP packages sent by the server (do not count the packages sent by your computer).
However, one of the packages is just an acknowledgement of the GET-request, so the total is actually 3 data-carrying TCP packets.

14. "200 OK".

15. Yes, in the first data-containing TCP packet, you can see (in the "packet bytes" section) that all of the header for the HTTP-packet is there. It is only present in the first packet, though, since the TCP packets do not use that data at all.

If a file is too large to send with one packet, the file is transmitted by x packages, each coded with a sequence number. These packages are combined into the HTTP response package in the application layer after all the packages are recieved.
