16. There were three GET-requests, all of which send their requests to different IP-addresses. The addresses are:
    128.119.245.12/ethereal-labs/lab2-4.html
    165.193.123.218/catalog/images/pearson-logo-footer.gif
    134.241.6.82/~kurose/cover.jpg

17. The two images were downloaded in parallel. You can tell by checking if the images were acquired before the next image request was sent.
E.g., both the requests were sent before any of the answers were received.

Objects can be gotten from several different servers, as long as the first server you connect to gives you an address to the next.
Files can also be gotten in several different ways, for example in parallel or one-by-one. Parallel is in most cases faster to do, but one-by-one is (arguably) safer.
